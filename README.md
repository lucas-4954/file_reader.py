# File Reader Script

A simple Python script that reads data from a text file and displays the contents in a clean, readable format.

## What This Program Does
- Opens a text file (`names.txt`)
- Reads each line from the file
- Cleans the data by removing extra whitespace
- Prints the contents line by line

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python file I/O
- Reading files using `with open()`
- Working with lists
- Looping through data
- Data cleaning using `.strip()`

## How to Run
1. Make sure `file_reader.py` and `names.txt` are in the same folder
2. Run the script from the terminal:

```bash
python file_reader.py
